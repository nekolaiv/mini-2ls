## Creating a NextJS Project (Only for Starting a New Project)

Once you have Node.js and a package manager installed, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a New Next.js App

Run one of the following commands to create a Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app my-next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with your desired project name.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the running application.

## Project Structure

You can start editing the project by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You're now set up with a Next.js project! ðŸŽ‰
